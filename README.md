# Unexpected useState Behavior in Next.js 15 App

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 applications related to the `useState` hook during client-side rendering, specifically when using experimental features like the `app` directory or React Server Components (RSC).

## Bug Description

The application throws an error during client-side rendering, displaying unexpected behavior from the `useState` hook within a component. This often occurs when the component is rendered on the client after an initial server-side render, leading to inconsistencies in state management.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the application in your browser.
5. Observe the error message during client-side rendering, indicating an issue with the `useState` hook.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing how the `useState` hook is used within components, ensuring that state updates are handled correctly and considering data fetching strategies for client-side rendering.  Potential solutions include optimizing data fetching using `use` or `SWR` to ensure data consistency.
